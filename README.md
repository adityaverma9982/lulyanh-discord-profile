<p>The original source code was made by <a href="https://github.com/Domin-MND">Domin</a>, and he allowed others to use his template. This repository was cloning from <a href="https://github.com/MiyagawaMizu">Mizu</a>'s repository. Her repository included a feature auto-detect user online status, so I added more feature like auto-update user avatar/banner, user status text and probably will update more if I have time.</p>
